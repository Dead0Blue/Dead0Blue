Hi, there  I'm Adam Ammour 👋

## 🚀 About me

I am Adam Ammour, a second year engineering student on **Semestre 8 at École Centrale Supélec – Campus Paris-Saclay**
My professional interests lie at the intersection of **AI, cryptography and quantum computing**.  
I aim to design robust, explainable ML systems for cybersecurity and to prepare cryptographic systems for the post-quantum era.

I enjoy turning research ideas into reproducible code and prototypes : from ML pipelines to small GUI tools  and I like to apply data science to real operational problems (SOC, malware detection, healthcare, finance).

## 🔭 Current focus

- Quantum Machine Learning for cryptography & post-quantum security  
- ML engineering: robust feature pipelines, model evaluation and explainability  
- Applied security: SOC workflows, malware feature engineering and detection  

## 🔭 Interests

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (practical modelling & deployment)  
- Cryptography & Post-quantum security (research + applied systems)  
- Quantum computing and quantum algorithms for ML  
- Cybersecurity operations & threat detection (SOC workflows)  
- Generative AI for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications
